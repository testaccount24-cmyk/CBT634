Installation instructions for the LISTUCB program.

   1.  You don't have to assemble the source.  You may just
        TSO RECEIVE INDS(this.pds($LOADLIB))
       and copy the load module UCBSUBR to a load library
       accessible to your TSO session.  Or, you can assemble
       UCBSUBR by customizing the JCL in member $ASSEMBL.

   2.  Copy the LISTUCB REXX to a library in the ISPEXEC or
       SYSPROC ddname concatenation for your TSO session.

   3.  Execute the LISTUCB exec without operands, to get the
       instructions on how to use it.

   4.  You might try to run LISTUCB with various of its operands
       in a Batch Job.  See member $BATJCL for an example.
